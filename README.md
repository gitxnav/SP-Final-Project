## Project Description

This project uses the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient has CKD or not. The dataset contains clinical and laboratory features with missing values, which are cleaned and processed before training and evaluating the model. The final model is deployed as an API that takes patient data as input and returns a diagnostic prediction.
